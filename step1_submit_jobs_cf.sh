# Submit jobs to Rescomp for generating extended output 
# from the IBM so as to calculate HIV/ART status in the 
# population.  This runs counterfactual simulations.  
# This job will run ~1000 simulations for each of the 
# 1000 accepted parameters from the calibration for 
# community 1 (Zambia, arm B).  Parameters were generated
# from calibration in 
# /well/fraser/users/probert/19_07_18_calibration_ias2019_param_limits.
# (The calibration before IAS 2019).  
# 
# See ./jobs/hptn_risk_groups_jobs.sh for details of the job script.
